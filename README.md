# __lingorator-project__
Lingorator is an application created for linguists to help them create new languages and learn about morphology and syntax. The user is able to create their own fully custom language by choosing the sounds (represented by IPA characters) that they would like to have appear in their language. The user can also select word order and the ratio of closed to open syllables. 

## Current status
Lingorator is not currently on the web. There are some issues that need to be dealt with both with the code and with the university where it was created before it can go live.

## Future plans 
The future plans for the project include some code fixes to increase security, including a new log in function. Following that the site will be made live. No further improvements will be made to lingorator as work is beginning on Lingorator 2.0, which will allow for non linguists to use the site as well. This will be accomplished by using machine learning algorithms to create proper syntax and morphology based on real world examples of language.
